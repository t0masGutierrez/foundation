# Problem

The governing conservation law is

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
+
\frac{\partial f(u)}{\partial x}
=0.
$$

with periodic boundary conditions

$$
u(t,0)=u(t,1).
$$

The initial conditions are sampled from a Gaussian process

$$
u(0,\cdot)\sim\mathcal{N}(0,k).
$$

The covariance kernel is

$$
k(x,x') =
\sigma^2
\exp\!\left(
-\frac{1-\cos\!\left(2\pi(x-x')\right)}
{\ell^2}
\right).
$$

\bigr)
\longmapsto
\hat{u}_q(t+\tau,x).

# In-Distribution Flux Functions

The training distribution consists of cubic flux functions

$$
f(u)=au^3+bu^2+cu,
$$

where

$$
a,b,c\sim U([-1,1]).
$$

# Forward and Reverse Operators

The forward time-evolution operator is

$$
F_{f,\tau}:
u(t,x)
\longmapsto
u(t+\tau,x).
$$

The reverse operator is

$$
R_{f,\tau}:
u(t+\tau,x)
\longmapsto
\bigl\{\,v \mid F_{f,\tau}(v)=u(t+\tau,x)\,\bigr\}.
$$

### Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $F_{f,\tau}$ | Forward evolution operator |
| $R_{f,\tau}$ | Reverse operator |
| $v$ | Candidate previous state |

# Out-of-Distribution Flux Functions

The model is evaluated on two flux functions not seen during training.

$$
f(u)=\sin(u)-\cos(u)
$$

and

$$
f(u)=\tanh(u).
$$
